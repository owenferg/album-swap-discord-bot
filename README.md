# OwenBot / Album Swap Bot
This is a project from early 2023 that I created for a small discord server as a personal passion project. It is entirely coded in Python and its main function was to have some simple commands that allowed users to check statistics about their involvement in a community event called Album Swaps, where users would submit an album to a forum and the albums would be (mostly) randomely selected and each user would receive an album they haven't listened to. Statistics were calculated using Pandas and updating the source csv file to add more data would also update the bot's data. This bot doesn't receive use anymore because this server stopped doing Album Swaps.
